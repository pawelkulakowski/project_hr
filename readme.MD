# HR analysis

The leadership team at Atlas Labs is looking to have visibility on high-level metrics about the state of its employees. In particular the organization is looking to understand the attrition at the company.

Attrition rate is a metric that quantifies the rate at which employees depart an organisation, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. It represents the pace of employee turnover, expressed as a percentage and serves as a key indicator for HR teams to evaluate retention efforts and understand organisational dynamics.

Employee attrition, also known as employee churn or turnove, refers to employees leaving an organization for any reason (voluntary or involuntary).

Project involves:
- importing and cleaning data from various sources
- using conditional columns in PowerQuery
- creating new measures with DAX
- creating visualisations according to requirements
- analyzing the attrition rate
